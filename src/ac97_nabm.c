/*
 * ac97_nabm.c -- AC'97 bus-master registers whose reset bit clears itself.
 *
 * DirectSoundCreate resets each audio DMA channel by writing RR ("Reset
 * Registers", bit 1) to the channel's control byte at NABM + 0x0B and waiting
 * for the controller to clear it. MC3's DSOUND (sub_003946AE) does it for the
 * channels at 0xFEC00110 and 0xFEC00170:
 *
 *     mov  byte [0xFEC0011B], 2
 *     mov  cl, [0xFEC0011B]        ; read ONCE: MSVC hoisted the load
 *     and  cl, 2
 *   L: test cl, cl
 *     jne  L                       ; spins forever if that read saw RR
 *
 * On hardware the reset is done before the read. The toolkit's "plain" AC'97
 * mode (POSIX, Switch: no fault handling) clears RR from a background thread
 * after the write, which loses against this single read -- the first watchdog
 * snapshot of MC3 sat exactly here. Windows traps the write instead.
 *
 * DSOUND is lifted with MMIO accessors (MC3_MMIO_SECTIONS), so its register
 * writes reach a device model. This one stores every byte to the same plain
 * memory the runtime already backs the aperture with -- reads and code that is
 * not MMIO-lifted see identical values -- except that RR never lands in a
 * control byte. Same channel sweep as the toolkit's ac97_clear_reset_bits
 * (+0x0B of every 16-byte channel in NABM 0x100..0x17F); RR only, never RPBM.
 *
 * Candidate for the toolkit: it fixes the plain mode for any hoisted poll.
